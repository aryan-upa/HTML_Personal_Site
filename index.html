        There are two tags which can italicize the text,
        1. <i> It italicizes the text, but it does not do the work of emphasis. </i>
        2. <em> This tag is used to show emphasis in the text, which is what is really required.</em>

        While writing HTML, our main purpose is to structure the text and not
        to care about styling. Thus, it is a preferred practice to use emphasis tag
        in place of I tag to italicize the text and show emphasis at the same time.

        Similar is the case with strong and b tag for Bold. The bold only deals with the
        bolding of the part, but the strong tag shows strong emphasis of that part in the text.

        There is a difference b/w Strong and Emphasis tag.
          The strong tag is used to show the strong emphasis of that part in the text,
          but the emphasis tag is used to show the difference in meaning if that part is emphasized.

          ex: I <em>love</em> Carrots. vs. I love <em>Carrots</em>.
          emphasizing different parts of the text creates different meaning.

          & for strong.
          ex: <strong>Red</strong> with <stong>black striped</stong> fire truck was at the spot.
          strongly emphasizing the red and black striped character of the truck.
